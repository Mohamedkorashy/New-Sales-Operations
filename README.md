## üìÑ Excel File Format

For the application to work correctly, your uploaded Excel file must contain a sheet with a header row with the following columns:

- `Unit Code` (Text)
- `Building Type` (Text)
- `Floor` (Number)
- `Area (m¬≤)` (Number)
- `Ownership Status` (Text: 'Available' or 'Sold')

The application includes basic validation to check for the presence of essential columns.
